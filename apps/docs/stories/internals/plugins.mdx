# Default Library Plugins

The library methods on the `ui` instance are implemented by plugins to the library.

Internally we include the following plugins, which provide default behavior for the library:

- **createComponent**: Creates the underlying component and implements the component behaviors.
- **createTemplate**: Creates a component template that can be used to render the component with a custom style.
- **componentVariants**: Create styles for the component's variants using `tailwind-variants`.

You can easily add features to your ui library by creating your own `UILibraryPlugin`.

# Creating a Plugin

A plugin is a function that receives the `UILibraryConfig` and returns a method for the library.

For example our `ui.variants()` method is implemented by the `componentVariants` plugin:

```tsx
import { tv as variants } from 'tailwind-variants';

export const componentVariantsPlugin = (config: UILibraryConfig) => (method: string) => variants;
```

In our plugin we import the `tailwind-variants` package and return a function that receives the plugin name and returns the variants function.

This way our plugin can receive both the `UILibraryConfig` and the method name it was called with, these can be used to configure plugin behavior if needed.
