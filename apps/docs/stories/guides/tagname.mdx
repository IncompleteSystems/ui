# The `as` Prop

The `as` prop allows you to render a component as a different component. This is useful for creating custom components that render a different HTML element than the one they are based on.

```jsx
import ui from '@incomplete/ui';

const Button = ui.button`text-white bg-blue-500 rounded`;

const App = () => (
  <Button as="a" href="https://example.com">
    Example
  </Button>
);
```

# The `asChild` Prop

The `asChild` prop allows you to render a component as it's child. This is useful for creating custom higher-order components that render a different HTML element than the one they are based on.

```jsx
import ui from '@incomplete/ui';

const Button = ui.button`text-white bg-blue-500 rounded`;

const App = () => (
  <Button asChild>
    <a href="https://example.com">Example</a>
  </Button>
);
```
