# The component template

## `className` based on Template Literals (Template Strings)

The `ui` object is a function that returns a component. It accepts a template literal as it's first argument. 

The template literal is parsed and converted into a CSS class string. The CSS class string is then passed to the component as a `className` prop.

```jsx
import ui from '@incomplete/ui';

// A button component created from a template literal
const Button = ui.button`text-white bg-blue-500 rounded`;
```

## `className` based on a Component Props

The `ui` object also accepts a function as it's first argument. The function is passed the component's properties and returns a value for `className` prop.

```jsx
import ui from '@incomplete/ui';

// A button component created from a className function
const Button = ui.button(({ rounded }) => `text-white bg-blue-500 ${rounded ? 'rounded' : ''}`);
```
